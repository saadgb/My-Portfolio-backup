        <p>Many hiring managers create an advertisement regarding vacancies on job boards or online portals and create online test forms on some other channels in which filtering out the best candidate for the job is tiresome. Hiring managers experience issues like time constraint and desired candidate selection during the screening procedure.</p>

          <p>Since there are a number of onboarding processess for hiring managers onsite for candidate screening, but on certain stages, a candidate may feel nervous or simply loose interest during the process. I built my design to deliver upon the following key points:</p>

      <p>I was looking to get a clear picture of how our primary users went about hiring a candidate through fast onboarding process. In order to get a better understanding of their usage and motivation, here are some research techniques I applied for the redesign.</p>

          <p>Hiring managers were always finding discomfort with the candidates when they engage them through onsite onboarding process. Due to awkwardness, these candidates left the interview in between or felt low in confidence while going through it. In many Scandinavian countries, candidate prefers going through online onboarding process.</p>

    <p>Based upon the data gathered from in-person interviews, surveys and reviews, I structured my observations and categorized them using a customer journey map.

It also helped me initialize discussions to understand knowledge gaps and idea generation between team and stakeholders.</p>

    <p>The initial user research uncovered various areas of opportunity, such as creating test and evaluating candidates automatically. However, as the nature of this project was MVP, I kept in mind the buisness goals and resource capacity and decided to work on some key areas, including optimizing user experience around job posting, creating test in quick way, creating hiring flows for the team, reviewing candidates and inviting candidates for video interviews, and thereby, meeting user and business goals including easy hiring and onbaording process, with a strong focus on shortlisting a right candidate to cut down the manual shortlisting process. The previous system also missed the flows and management of the data strategy. The redesign was to reduce these shortcomings.</p>

        </span>
        <p>The intial app was serving for a single warehouse industry but later on we expanded support for major industries as well which required us to create a unified design system for the app which was called as Cubivue App. It will support all the basic required features by major industries. Originally, there was no generalized app for the future industries, where our UX resources could map new industries on the exisiting platform to create wireframes and mockups for the customers.</p>

            <li class="list-group-item">I built a simplified design system for the mobile application to be used by UX resources for their customers and for the app developers who may utilize this unified design components and features for the base app. The end product helps digitize the processes of understanding and creating a standard for the app which are easily demostratable for the user and for the developers to create base app.</li>

            <li class="list-group-item">I worked in a team with a fellow designer and a product manager to design the end-to-end UI/UX for the Android and iOS application. It was used for designing the base app and mapping future industries to serve optmized experience for their specified processess. I worked closely with my team to gather design requirements, feedback, conduct user testing on wireframes, functional prototypes and visual designs, both for Android and iOS. I also worked with a team of developers to ensure delivery of the final product.</li>

      <div class="title-line "></div>
      <p>User Research was critical to this project since we were designing for diverse type of industries which were unknown to us. One of the first things we did was, to draft a basic information architecture to understand the common key values. We identified various common variables which we can serve to our clients in the base app. We gathered information from different industries where we were already serving our customers e.g. Cleaning industry etc.</p>

      <h3 class="font-weight-bold p-heads pt-5">FINDINGS</h3>
      <div class="title-line "></div>
      <p>We identified the common variables we required for the base Cubivue app. By researching and consulting with the stakeholders, we streamlined our basic features which we will give in our base app.</p>

      <div class="title-line "></div>
    <p>Upon gathering features layout and identifying required information, I carefully designed the mockups for the base Cubivue app. This design system will help future resources to map new industries and also it will give technical design guide for the developers so they can all collaborate effeciently.</p>

      <div class="title-line "></div>
    <p>One of the biggest challenge for designing this platform was, to map all the required information which will help UX resources to use it to present it in a meaningful format for the upcoming industries. I wanted the UI and flows to achieve the following objectives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add basic flows and features to the base Cubivue app</li>
      <li>Design a detailed system which defines all components and the guides for the developers and stakeholders</li>
      <li>Bird's eye view of all the industry's flows</li>
      <li>Future support for new upcoming industries to map it on the base Cubivue app</li>
    </ul>

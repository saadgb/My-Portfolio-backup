This app let the user save all the music files to their phone so they can enjoy it in offline mode. Also users can create their playlists and share it with their social media friends.

        <p>Ibex solutions had pakistani music content license in which they were already airing on their in-house radio channel on the requests of their audience but later on the product design team came up with the idea that if they can design a new app where they can serve all the Pakistani music content in the hand of their audience with offline support then it could be a viable product.</p>

            <li class="list-group-item">I designed the app's basic design and scope documents as required by the directors to pitch the idea of the app with my product development team. Before moving on to the app development we had a structure of approval of any product so for this I created high fidelity wireframes in the form of basic ideas after the design and scope step. Then I moved to visual designs which served as mockups and design guide for the developers to use all the components and assets for their development envirnoment (Android and iOS). The designing of the app process was itterative as at many steps we need to came back to fix the flows and modify the features as required. </li>

      <div class="title-line "></div>
    <p>I was also responsible to generate assets for the app development so for this process I used a slicing tool plugin (PNG Express) in Photoshop in which it easily extracted assets according to the Android and iOS design guides.</p>
